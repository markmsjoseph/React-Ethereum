## Transactions take place across the ethereum blockchain.
## Users can join campaigns(funding for a project) by contributing above the minimum contribution towards the campaign.
## The contributions can then be sent to different vendors in order to purchase items.
## Campaigns have owners and in order for owners to further their startup and spend the funds towards a particular item/purchase from a vendor, some percentage of persons who contributed must agree that the money being spent is towards a wise decision. Contributors must approve the spending request of the owner of the campaign in order for the owner to be able to spend the money.
